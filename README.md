## Install
```
npm install
```

## Test
Testing requires an ethereum network to be running.
You can download and use [truffle/ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).
If the network is running you can use the following command to run tests.

```
npm test
```

Alternatively you can use truffles built in network.
Within their cli you can then manually run truffle test.

```
# opens truffle cli
truffle develop

# within truffle cli
migrate
test
```
